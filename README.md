# Token Coin

Token coin contract is a simple solidity program that provide way in which user can create a token with the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract offers a way on how to start decentralized finance on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing program

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the code from the repo into the file you created.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18", and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint function, burn function, balances, token name, token symbol, total supply of the token. Click on the "myToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then expand on the "mint" function then input address of the creator and the supply. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and check balance by using the address of the creator of the token .

You can as well do for the burn function, but now you are reducing the amount of supply token instead of adding to the supply like how mint does.
